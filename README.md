**C/C++ CodeCraft** is a comprehensive collection of C and C++ code snippets designed to enhance productivity and simplify the development process. This extension provides easy-to-use and powerful code snippets that are aligned with the latest standards, including C23 and C++23.

## Features

- **C Code Snippets**: Quickly insert commonly used C constructs such as loops, conditionals, memory management, and file operations.
- **C++ Code Snippets**: Insert modern C++ constructs including smart pointers, lambdas, concepts, and range-based for loops.
- **Support for Latest Standards**: Snippets are up-to-date with the latest C23 and C++23 standards.
- **Easy to Use**: Just type the prefix `ccraft-` followed by the snippet name to insert the code.

## Installation

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Sidebar or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. Search for `C/C++ CodeCraft`.
4. Click **Install** to install the extension.
